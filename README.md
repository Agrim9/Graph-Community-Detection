# Graph Community Detection

The codes require `igraph` package in `python3`, which can be installed using `pip3 install python-igraph`. 
> P.S. Please make sure you do `pip3 install python-igraph` and not `pip 3 install igraph`, since doing the latter one installs some other `igraph` package.

Once the `igraph` package has been installed, the code can be run by `python3 implementation.py`. The first figure you will get will be of the graph and the labelled nodes, **close it** to continue, and wait for 1 minute or so to get the detected community figure !

* Have a look at [Presentation](./Presentation.pdf), and [Report](./Report.pdf) for details 
* You can also run the [ipython notebook](./Community-Detection.ipynb) to see the implementation
